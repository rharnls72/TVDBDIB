#회원 정보 관리 모바일 웹 소스

웹 서비스에서 주로 사용되는 로그인, 로그아웃, 비밀번호 변경 등
회원 정보 관리 기능을 MariaDB, Spring-boot, Vue.js 를 사용하여
모바일 웹 화면으로 구성한 소스 파일입니다.

## Before You Begin
시작하기 앞서 아래 세 가지 기술에 대해 알아보는 것을 추천드립니다 :
* MariaDB - MariaDB 회사에서 개발한 RDBMS로 MySQL의 유료화에 반발해 MySQL 코드를 기반으로 만든 오픈소스 RDBMS 입니다.
Web site : [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* Spring Boot - Spring 프로젝트가 제공하는 다양한 라이브러리와 프레임워크로 빠르게 엔터프라이즈 어플리케이션을 개발 할 수 있게 하는 프레임워크로 본 프로젝트에서는 RestAPI 를 사용하는 웹 백엔드 개발에 사용됩니다.
Web site : [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* Vue.js - 웹 프론트엔드를 SPA 기반으로 개발하기 위한 프레임워크로 Angular.js의 데이터 바인딩 특성과 React의 가상 돔 기반 렌더링 특징을 모두 가지고 있습니다.
Web site : [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Downloading MEAN.JS
There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get MEAN.js is to use git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs
```

This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` and `bower.json` files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

Explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options.

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration:

```bash
$ npm run start:prod
```

Explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options.

### Running with User Seed
To have default account(s) seeded at runtime:

In Development:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true npm start
```
It will try to seed the users 'user' and 'admin'. If one of the user already exists, it will display an error message on the console. Just grab the passwords from the console.

In Production:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true npm start:prod
```
This will seed the admin user one time if the user does not already exist. You have to copy the password from the console and save it.

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ npm run generate-ssl-certs
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute prod task `npm run start:prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`


## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:

```bash
$ npm test
```
This will run both the server-side tests (located in the `app/tests/` directory) and the client-side tests (located in the `public/modules/*/tests/`).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ npm run test:server
```

To execute only the server tests and run again only changed tests, run the test:server:watch task:

```bash
$ npm run test:server:watch
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ npm run test:client
```

## Running your application with Gulp

The MEAN.JS project integrates Gulp as build tools and task automation.

We have wrapped Gulp tasks with npm scripts so that regardless of the build tool running the project is transparent to you.

To use Gulp directly, you need to first install it globally:

```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

Then start the development environment with:

```bash
$ gulp
```

To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute gulp as follows:

```bash
$ gulp prod
```

It is also possible to run any Gulp tasks using npm's run command and therefore use locally installed version of gulp, for example: `npm run gulp eslint`

## Development and deployment With Docker

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)
* Install [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

* Local development and testing with compose:
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

* Local development and testing with just Docker:
```bash
$ docker build -t mean .
$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 mean
$
```

* To enable live reload, forward port 35729 and mount /app and /public as volumes:
```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/public:/home/mean/public -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/app:/home/mean/app --link db:db_1 mean
```

### Production deploy with Docker

* Production deployment with compose:
```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d
```

* Production deployment with just Docker:
```bash
$ docker build -t mean -f Dockerfile-production .
$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 mean
```

## Getting Started With MEAN.JS
You have your application running, but there is a lot of stuff to understand. We recommend you go over the [Official Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html).
In the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep it updated by your request. You can also help us develop and improve the documentation by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.
